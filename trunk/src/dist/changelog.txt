Change log
----------

version 2.7
-----------

- Added support for Premiere Pro CS4

version 2.6
-----------

- Added support for Vegas 9.0 and above.
- Added autoupdate check, frameserver will check for new releases and inform the user when available.

version 2.5
-----------

- Added option to export video frames as an image sequence.

version 2.3
-----------

1. Frameserver now works as a plugin with Debugmode Wax!!
2. Fixed audio length issue in signpost AVI file. If the 'raw PCM audio' option was enabled the signpost AVI file was showing the audio stream to be 4 times longer than actual, causing problems with encoders like TMPGenc. Fixed now.

version 2.2
-----------

1. Added workaround for bug in Premiere Elements 1.0 API. Frameserver now supports 
   Premiere Elements too.

version 2.01
------------

1. Fixed crash when serving from Ulead MSP. This happened when audio was
   also being served.

version 2.0
------------

1. Changed name from "PluginPac Frameserver" to "DebugMode FrameServer" due
   to phasing out of other PluginPac plugins (they have been integrated into
   the new 'Wax' plugin/app)

2. Added 2 new serving formats (RGB24 & YUY2, YUY2 can be useful if running on
   PremierePro). Default was RGB32 earlier, and now it is RGB24 so efficiency
   will be slightly better. Using RGB24 also makes sure in hosts like Premiere
   where the alpha channel is also given to the plugin, your fades will work
   fine (the fades only modified alpha so in earlier versions if the target app
   does not recognize alpha then the fade wont be visible)

3. Streamlined the Frameserver interface and made it into a two step process -
   first the FS asks for user options and then goes into serving mode.

4. Frameserver now supports a new NLE - Pure Motion EditStudio. Also it has been
   modified and tested to work with Ulead VideoStudio.

5. Added feature - network frameserving! Just enable a checkbox in the FS options
   and your video can be accessed over the network. The target machine must have
   the frameserver installed. For more info about network serving instructions
   have a look at the README.

6. Added feature - the signpost AVI file (output of the FrameServer) will be deleted
   when the Frameserver is closed. This was asked by many users, so that they dont 
   open the file again by mistake to go into an infinite dialog box loop.

version 1.62
-------------
1. When choosing the option "save pcm audio in avi", it would take a while
   for the AVI file to be written. In this time if the "Stop serving" button
   is clicked this operation would stop and the pcm audio option would be
   disabled. When the frameserver is run the next time pcm audio would not
   be written to AVI.

2. Fixed a bug which caused Vegas Frameserver Plugin to crash while serving
   audio, happened at different times for different audio sampling rate settings.
   (If PCM audio option was used this crash did not happen).


version 1.6
-------------
1. Updated Premiere plugin to work with Premiere Pro's new SDK. Other
   NLE plugins were not modified (except for the version numbers in the 
   about dialogs).

version 1.5.2
-------------
1. Changed the Premiere plugin so users will have to use menu 
   "File>Export>Movie" in Premiere and choose "PluginPac Frameserver"
   to frameserve. This way you can serve full project or workarea 
   only (earlier always full project was served) and you can choose 
   the frame size to export also.


Version 1.5.0
-------------
1. Added Premiere plugin for FrameServer
2. Added MediaStudio Pro plugin for FrameServer
3. Added stats
4. Added PCM audio save to signpost feature
5. optimized for performance

Version 1.4.1
-------------
1. First version, only for Vegas/Vegas Video/Video Factory.
